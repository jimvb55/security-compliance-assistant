## 1. Product Overview

Modern vendor-security questionnaires are repetitive, time-consuming, and require consistent answers that align with company policy and SOC 2 controls. The **Security Compliance Assistant** is an internal, Dockerized application that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull answers from the company‚Äôs policy library (PDFs, docs) and draft or auto-fill browser-based questionnaires.  
Primary goals:

* Reduce average questionnaire turnaround time by **70 %**.  
* Ensure **100 % policy alignment** across all outgoing security responses.  
* Provide auditors a reproducible evidence trail.

## 2. User Personas & Key User Stories

| Persona | Description | Representative Stories |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Security Analyst (SA) | Owns completion of questionnaires | 1. *As an SA, I upload a questionnaire PDF and receive a pre-filled draft.*<br>2. *As an SA, I ask follow-up questions (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our encryption at rest policy?‚Äù) and get authoritative snippets plus citations.* |
| Vendor Manager (VM) | Coordinates with customers/vendors | 3. *As a VM, I track questionnaire status and deadlines in a dashboard.* |
| CISO | Oversees compliance posture | 4. *As the CISO, I review AI-generated answers before release and see source documents/citations.* |
| DevOps Engineer | Maintains platform | 5. *As DevOps, I deploy the entire stack with one `docker compose up` and integrate with company SSO.* |

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| FR-1 | Ingest security policy PDFs/docs, convert to text, chunk, embed, and store in a vector DB with metadata (version, owner, tags). |
| FR-2 | Semantic search API returns top-K relevant chunks with citation metadata. |
| FR-3 | RAG pipeline synthesizes answers using hosted LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Anthropic) + retrieved context. |
| FR-4 | Questionnaire Workspace: upload questionnaires (PDF, DOCX, web form URL) and view auto-generated drafts. |
| FR-5 | Browser automation agent fills common web questionnaire portals (SaaS, spreadsheets) via code-generation (OpenAI Codex-style) with human-in-the-loop approval. |
| FR-6 | Inline editor to accept/revise answers; changes fed back for fine-tuning/feedback loop. |
| FR-7 | Audit log with timestamps, user, source citations, and diff of edits. |
| FR-8 | Role-based access control (RBAC) integrated with company SSO (OIDC/SAML). |
| FR-9 | Admin panel to manage documents, embeddings refresh, and model settings. |

### 3.2 Non-Functional

* Response latency < 3 s for typical queries.  
* 99.5 % uptime.  
* All data processed/stored within company VPC; no data sent to public LLM without encryption and legal approval.  
* System must support ‚â• 1 M document chunks.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Component Diagram (textual)

1. **Ingestion Service**
   * PDF‚ÜíText (Grobid + Tika)  
   * Cleans, chunks (‚âà 500 tokens), embeddings via **OpenAI Embedding** or **local E5 model**.

2. **Vector Store**
   * **pgvector** on Postgres or **Qdrant**.  
   * Metadata: `doc_id`, `chunk_id`, `tags`, `version`.

3. **Retrieval API**
   * Semantic search endpoint (`/retrieve?q=`) returning JSON with text + citation.

4. **LLM Gateway**
   * Wraps external LLM provider; adds retry, cost limits, prompt templates, and redaction.

5. **Application Server**
   * GraphQL / REST     * Orchestrates workflows, questionnaires, browser-agent commands.

6. **Browser Automation Agent**
   * Headless Chromium + Python/Playwright.  
   * Code-gen suggestions ‚Üí Analyst approves ‚Üí Executes.

7. **Web UI (React/Next.js)**
   * Document manager, questionnaire workspace, dashboards.

8. **AuthN/AuthZ**
   * Keycloak/OIDC; JWT propagated to services.

9. **Logging & Monitoring**
   * Loki/Grafana; audit logs to immutable S3 bucket.

10. **Containerization & Deployment**
    * Docker images per service; `docker-compose.yml` / Helm for prod.  
    * Runs in company Kubernetes or ECS Fargate.

### 4.2 Data Flow (Happy Path)

`PDF upload` ‚Üí Ingestion ‚Üí Vector Store  
`Analyst query` ‚Üí Retrieval API (top-K) ‚Üí LLM Gateway (prompt w/ context) ‚Üí Draft Answer ‚Üí UI  
`Approved answer` ‚Üí Browser Agent ‚Üí External Portal ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Audit log.

## 5. Security Considerations

1. **Data Segmentation** ‚Äì Each client/vendor questionnaire stored in isolated namespace with row-level security.  
2. **Encryption** ‚Äì TLS 1.2+ in transit, AES-256 at rest (EBS, S3, DB).  
3. **Secrets Management** ‚Äì Vault or AWS Secrets Manager; no keys in containers.  
4. **Access Control** ‚Äì RBAC enforced via middleware; least-privilege service accounts.  
5. **Model Safety** ‚Äì Prompt guardrails to strip sensitive PII from LLM prompts when policy prohibits.  
6. **Audit & Compliance** ‚Äì Immutable, time-stamped logs; SOC 2 control mapping table maintained.  
7. **Supply-Chain** ‚Äì Images scanned (Trivy), SBOM stored; no root containers.  
8. **Disaster Recovery** ‚Äì Daily encrypted snapshots, RPO ‚â§ 24 h, RTO ‚â§ 4 h.

## 7. Success Metrics

* üïí Median questionnaire completion time  
  Baseline: 10 days ‚Üí Target: 3 days

## 8. Open Questions / Risks

1. Licensing & token cost for hosted LLM‚Äîbudget approval needed.  
2. Browser automation reliability across diverse portals.  
3. Legal review for any data sent to third-party LLMs.  
4. Long-term retention and versioning of embeddings vs. policy updates.
